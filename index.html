      <h1>Redialling (2025-07-25)</h1>
      <p>
        I am redesigning this website to represent me more, originally wanted a
        subtle gradient background but the <i>sizing</i> wouldn't budge and so I
        settled with this darkish-green-almost-black background for the dark
        theem of the website. The background on the light theme of the site
        remains unchanged for legibility. Additionally, I changed the font from
        using either your device's built-in sans-serif font or
        <b style="font-family: Inter; font-weight: 600">Inter</b> if it's
        installed to IBM Plex Sans since it matches the system font I have on my
        desktop.

        11 days ago, I hit the 1 year mark of being on estrogen. I started
        taking it knowing full well I would need to maintain my hormone levels
        so that my transition would work effectively. My transitioning is taking
        a toll financially, but this is my responsibility to be who I am and be
        emotionally connected with my true self.
      </p>
      <p>
        A week before that, I had my ears pierced. They picked out silver studs
        which isn't my style frankly, but I do find them to look nice and pretty
        on me.

      <h1>A more mobile website (2025-02-14)</h1>
      <p>
        I have been trying to refine the layout of this website to better suit
        mobile visitors. The header for page navigation has been relocated to
        the bottom of the screen for better reach. Although, I don't find having
        the page title moved to the bottom to be coherent.
      </p>
      <h1>An introduction (2025-02-14)</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Junie. I live somewhere in Southeast Asia, therefore, our
        timezones may not be ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Navigate through the pages in my site using the header on top. Access
        levels of pages in the sidebar at the left. My social links are also in
        the sidebar.
      </p>
      <h2>Why does your website look like this?</h2>
      <p>I took inspiration from the 9front.org website.</p>
      <p>
        Since this home page content should be occupied by something I decided
        to copy the content from one of the posts in here. I think I will switch
        it up just for special occasions if I feel like it.
