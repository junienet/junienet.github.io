      <h1>Speedcubing (2025-03-24)</h1>
      <p>
        Speedsolving puzzles has been a little hobby of mine for almost a decade
        now, I don't want this post to be just about the cube in question as it
        would make a pretty short post , so the title does not seem appropriate
        given what you are about to read later on.
      </p>
      <h2>The Rubix Cube</h2>
      <p>
        Anyways, I first picked up a Rubik's branded cube when I was 5. I still
        have the same cube albeit it turns very horribly compared to my other
        puzzles; I don't even remember whether it turned this badly back then.
        The cube is stickered compared to nowadays with tiles. You can imagine
        some stickers falling off over the years, and why yes some did fell off,
        all the others stuck well and show zero sign of wear(probably from lack
        of usage). Picking up this cube now, it's so horribly tight and turns
        like a brick.
      </p>
      <h2>Feliks Zemdegs</h2>
      <p>
        It wasn't until I was 11 when I got introduced to the concept of
        speedsolving. Prior to this, I used an app where you have to manually
        input the colour tiles of your scrambled 3x3 puzzle. I wondered why the
        solver app wouldn't budge when I input an <i>illegal piece</i>*, so
        thats when I started looking into it. Not long while searching, I saw
        the video of probably the most famous 3x3 single WR set by Feliks
        Zemdegs with a time of 4.73s. That one video is engraved in my mind and
        stands out as my introduction to speedcubing. It's also known famously
        for many things, I'll leave that one up for you to look up.
      </p>
      <h2>My first speedcube</h2>
      <p>
        Before I even looked up any tutorials, I asked my mum to order a
        speedcube as I had seen many a reviews on them. I chose the
        MofangJiaoshi(Moyu) MF3RS since I have heard it's a good speedcube for
        beginners since I have heard it's a good speedcube for beginners. It was
        probably JRcuber's or J Perm's videos which convinced me. Anyways, I
        searched for resources on youtube - but I searched for sub 10 seconds
        tutorial because I thought the number in a sub-x solve should go higher
        if you want to go faster and not the other way round.
      </p>
      <h2>First solves</h2>
      <p>
        None of that would reach in my mind so I looked up a beginner's tutorial
        for any of it to make sense. The beginner's method I learnt took me from
        a solving time of a minute and a half(1:30) down to the high 40s. During
        that, I slowly learnt to solve with the first cross on the bottom
        instead of the top for efficiency. Gradually getting used to finger
        tricks for specific turns.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference between my early solves and my later solves with the
        beginner's method was astonishing. However, I find it not enough of an
        improvement to reach sub-40(which was my goal back then).
      </p>
      <h2>356</h2>
      <p>
        So I've done and memorised all of the beginner's method algorithms, what
        would be the next logical step? Obviously it would be learning CFOP, but
        to do that, little me, for whatever reason, asked mum for... *drumroll*
        a Gan 3x3 cube. For those who don't know, Gan is the equivalent to Apple
        in terms of the speedcubes they sold. They were innovative back then.
        Nowadays, not so much. The one thing that is constant between the two of
        those are the exorbitant prices. I somehow convinced her to get a Gan(s)
        356 Air Master which was on sale back then. When I got it, let's just
        say I was dissatisfied. The box it came in didn't feature any of the GES
        nuts, which was the craze for them back then. I felt like I got ripped
        off. This sort of left a sour taste in me for Gan products.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gan cube I got would be my first and last Gan cube I would ever
        have. I did a lot of solves on the Gan and was pretty unsatisfied with
        it since I felt like it performs marginally worse than my MF3RS. During
        this time I didn't know how to set up a cube by its tensions or how
        lubed it is. Keep in mind also that magnetic mass-produced cubes were
        still taking off.
