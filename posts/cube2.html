      <h2>Picking up the pieces</h2>
      <p>
        Picking up where we stopped last time, magnetic speedcubes were a
        premium back then. Initially being exclusive to sponsored world class
        cubers, then trickling down to cubing stores selling cubes modded with
        magnets, until finally cubing companies started selling their magnetic
        cubes en masse. However, the pricing of these cubes were a fortune to
        say the least.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn't until YJ came out with their newest magnetised release, the YJ
        MGC 3x3 puzzle that I became interested in getting one for myself. Their
        offering costed a generous amount compared to the competition. But if I
        wanted a magnetic cube one day, I'm gonna need to set a better time than
        subpar sub-50 times. It was either the MGC or the GTS2 M.
      </p>
      <h2>Car Puzzle</h2>
      <p>
        Oh yeah, I got myself a Moyu Weilong GTS2 not long after getting the Gan
        puzzle. I still have both of those cubes in my collection. The only one
        missing is my MF3RS unfortunately. But if I had to compare between the
        three cubes, the Weilong feels far superior compared to the Gan. I could
        be biased though since my first speedcube is a Moyu speedcube.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Weilong feels like a more premium MF3RS, though I prefer the MF3RS
        more. I would describe the MF3RS as having a lighter "Weilong" feel. By
        this point, my times have gotten negligibly quicker. But then, I
        stopped.
      </p>
      <h2>6 years</h2>
      <p>
        I never had gotten one magnetic speedcube, because I stopped speedcubing
        abruptly. I was being bombarded with schoolwork, is all I could say.
        Another part of me believed I stopped because it was getting
        "mainstream", but I think it's just nonsense to me as the community is
        still as positive as ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently returned to speedcubing because someone had brought in their
        own speedcube to toy with (I believe it was a QiYi M Pro 3x3), I got
        surprised hearing that magnetic puzzles have gotten cheaper over the
        years. Now I searched for Gan cubes (for some reason) and assumed it
        would have gotten cheaper, right? Wrong, they still cost as pricey as
        ever. But that's for their latest release. Their older ones would cost a
        lot cheaper too, right? You guessed it, it's still pricey compared to
        what other brands are offering.
      </p>
      <h2>To sticker, or not to sticker</h2>
      <p>
        One cube that has picqued my interest is the Qiyi XMD Tornado V3, I was
        rather dumbfounded by the different versions it had. I was confused
        between whatever surface options they offered. I mean, UV coating? That
        sounded like a ridiculous type of material to put on a puzzle. As this
        was my first time buying a stickerless puzzle, (I had a stickerless Qiyi
        Pyraminx, but that's only because there was no stickered version up for
        sale) since I quit speedcubing before the <i>WCA*</i> made stickerless
        puzzles legal in the regulations. It was sort of odd seeing no puzzles
        sold in a stickered variant on the market.
      </p>
      <p>
        I kind of miss the looks of a stickered puzzle. It's classic, but the
        cons outweigh the pros of it, because stickered puzzles could wear out
        compared to stickerless ones. This convinced me to get a stickerless
        one, not that I have any other options anyway. Speaking of options,
        there are three surface options of which are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Glossy</b> - As the name suggests, the surface is smooth plastic,
          your fingers grip this kind of surface easily. But beware that having
          wet hands can make the puzzle slip out of your hands. It's still found
          on some cheap puzzles, like on the base model XMD Tornado 3x3 puzzles,
          and the Dayan Guhong Pro.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Matte/Frosted</b> - I have no idea what the difference is between
          frosted and matte so I'll group them together. This type of surface is
          typically found on cheaper variants of puzzles nowadays, but it was
          one of two surface options between 2019 and 2021, the other being
          glossy surface. Gan and Moyu popularised this surface type. It usually
          wears down into a more glossy look the more it is used. However, some
          earlier stickerless puzzles back in 2017 used a frosted surface, which
          doesn't seem to wear down.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>UV Coated</b> - A new type of surface "invented" by Gan. Puzzles in
          this variant cost a fortune compared to their matte/glossy
          counterpart. An example being the HuaMeng TG. This surface feels like
          a glossy surface, except it's a lot shinier and it's not easily
          scratched. Has the benefits and disadvantages of a glossy surface but
          cranked up to 5. Doesn't help that some puzzles can have flaws in
          their UV coating application. Gan, obviously has the best UV coating
          application whereas some Moyu puzzles can have imperfections.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This sounds overwhelming, but to simplify, glossy/uv is good when dry
        hands, not good when sweaty whereas matte is good when wet hands or worn
        down by a lot, not good when out of the box while frosted is a no go on
        so many levels unless you have sweaty hands all the time.
      </p>
      <h2>Red pill or blue pill**</h2>
      <p>
        The Tornado V3 picqued my interest because a lot of people say it feels
        so good and has adjustable magnet strengths. I went in blindly and
        bought the CHEAPEST variant of the bunch, which do not include the
        <i><b>corner piece to core magnets</b></i
        >. Now not to bash the puzzle, it is actually REALLY REALLY good
        compared to my other ones. It felt like a good deal, but I couldn't
        claim it to be the best puzzle of all time since this was the only
        modern 3x3 puzzle that I have and I couldn't compare it to anything
        else.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so I bought a Moyu RS3M V5 for really cheap. It has a matte surface
        compared to the Tomato V3's glossy surface. It started out very slippery
        to hold but after many solves, it wore down to be slightly shinier and
        grippier than before. At this point, my
        <b style="color: blue; font-weight: normal">house</b> might have one too
        many twisty puzzles. But I needed the expand my collection with quality
        puzzles, and not cheap dollar store puzzles. I got rid of most of the
        cheap puzzles since theres no point in keeping those and I only have
        sentimental value for one of those.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Moyu MFJSMF3RS3M2025 <sub>this section feels like a shitpost</sub>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Anyways, the RS3M V5 felt nothing like the Weilong that I have despite
        being a Moyu cube. I couldn't draw comparisons with it and its ancestor,
        the MF3RS because I lost it at some point :(<br />
        I like the RS3M V5 more than my Tornado V3, which is ironic but not
        surprising given that the Tomato is a more expensive puzzle than the
        aforementioned puzzle.
      </p>
      <p>
        I couldn't get this feeling of FOMO out of my head, by not getting the
        version of the Tomato which included the corner to core magnets. I had
        to do something about it, I had to. And so I began a j<br />I bought the
        flagship version of the Tomato. <br />It kind of felt a lot more
        stable??? I could NOT feel a significant difference other than having
        some form of FOMO off my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh yea I also bought the Ball-Core UV version of the RS3M V5 and I use
        it as my main now.

            Corner to core magnets/Ball core is a type of upgrade where it adds
            magnets to the core where it point towards the corner stalks of the
            cube, the magnets are installed on the corner stalks. This makes
            turning the cube feel more stable.
